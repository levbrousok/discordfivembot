Hey, installing this may seem complicated but trust me I did the hard work.

First download the files and extract them to your desktop (for easy use).
Go to https://nodejs.org download the one that says "Recommend for most users".
Open the file and at the top where it says "discordbot" or "discordbot-master" change the top to "cmd" and press "enter".
Then type in "npm install".
Once that has been completed you need to head over to "https://discord.com/developers/applications".
Now you need to sign into your discord account.
Click "New Application".
Type in the name you want.
Click on your bot's name if it hasn't loaded you into it's control panel.
Click on "Bot" at the left hand side.
Now click "Create Bot"
You can add a image if you want to.
Now click on copy under the "Token". (DON'T SHARE YOUR TOKEN!!)
Now go to the config.json
You should see something that says "READ THE README file"
Just replace that with what you copied.
Save the file and drag into your resources file and start in your server.cfg

Now we need to invite the bot to our server.
Go back to the bot's control panel and find the client ID copy that.
Then paste it in the "your_client_id_here" in the URL below
